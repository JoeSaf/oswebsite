  <h1>Welcome to <em>NeJo OS</em></h1>
  <p>A minimal, blazing-fast Linux OS built for developers and pentesters.</p>
  <p>Considering the rapid growth in Tanzania's technology, we thought it'd be better to have<br>
  a distribution catered to meet our needs.<br></p>
  <em>Why an Arch based distro?</em>
  <p>I think we can all come to a certain level of agreement that having control over our systems without betraying<br>
  performance has been and is always our goal. Our comfortability with the archiso allows us to build <em>you</em> a distro<br>
  that is unbloated and only comes with necessary items to get your system up and running.
  <br>
  We have included a post installation script that will allow you to pick between two careers, <br><em>1. Developer</em>
  <br><em>2. Security</em>
  </p>
  <p>Available in openbox, kde and hyprland</p>
